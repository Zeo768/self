    "## Short summary\n",
    "In this exercise you will: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Train CNNs for a binary classification problem\n",
    "* Visualize how CNN interprets the data\n",
    "* Train a CNN for a 3-class classification problem\n",
    "* Train RNN on a time series prediction problem\n",
    "* Visualize how RNN hidden node activities\n",
    "* Sample from a RNN character model\n",
    "* (Optional) Train a CNN to count corners in polygons. (This problem is defined in another notebook.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will look at network architectures that are designed to handle specific kinds of data. Convolutional Neural Networks for image processing and Recurrent Neural Networks for time series processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline for submitting the report: January 7, 12:00 (2020)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data\n",
    "Digits \"5\" and \"6\" from the MNIST database used for a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset consisting of circles, rectangles or triangles. \n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset consisting of pairs of times series. The input time series is a train of rectangle pulses, and the output is triangles, i.e. an up-ramp followed by a down-ramp. For more details see the cell *Ex4-1*. The task is to train a recurrent network that predicts the triangle time series from the pulse time series.\n",

    "The last exercise is using the Tensorflow source code (C++) represented as a long sequence of characters. See that cell for more details.\n",

    "In order for you to start with the exercise you need to run all cells with the CellType \"Needed\". The very first time you start with this exercise we suggest that you enter each of the needed cells, read the cell instruction and run the cell. It is important that you do this in the correct order, starting from the top and work you way down the cells. Later when you have started to work with the notebook it may be easier to use the command \"Run All\" found in the \"Cell\" dropdown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing the report\n",
    "First the report should be written within this notebook. We have prepared the last cell in this notebook for you where you should write the report. The report should contain 4 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Name:\n",
    "* Introduction: A **few** sentences where you give a small introduction of what you have done in the lab.\n",
    "* Answers to questions: For each of the questions provide an answer. It can be short answers or a longer ones depending on the nature of the questions, but try to be effective in your writing.\n",
    "* Conclusion: Summarize your findings in a few sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you write the report in this last cell and **not** after each question! When you are ready upload your report to Live@Lund.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this first exercise you are going to train a CNN that can separate between numbers \"5\" and \"6\" from the mnist dataset (mnist56 dataset). We are going to use 2000 training images and 1850 test images. To start with we have a proposed CNN that can solve this problem. It consists of the following:\n",
    "* First convolutional layer consisting of 4 kernels of size 3x3, with ReLU activation\n",
    "* Maxpooling of size 2x2\n",
    "* Second convolutional layer of 4 kernels of size 3x3, with ReLU activation\n",
    "* Maxpooling of size 2x2\n",
    "* Special layer *Flatten()*, just transforms the all of the max pooled filter outputs to a linear vector of outputs\n",
    "* *Dense* layer, meaning a fully connected MLP like layer with 10 nodes, again ReLU activation\n",
    "* Final output layer consisting of one single output node with sigmoid activation function because we have a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default is to use *stride* = 1 and no *padding*. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 1\n",
    "Make sure you understand the definition of the CNN model in the cell below and train it. **What is your test set performance in terms of the accuracy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 2\n",
    "This image classification problem should be relatively easy since a \"5\" has some distict differences from a \"6\". Experiment with the architecture of the CNN model and try to make it smaller, but with the same almost perfect test accuracy. **How many parameters do you have in your trimmed model and state your architecture?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** There is of course very many ways you can make a smaller architecture. You do not need to test all of them!\n"

The post_pool variable can be set to *True* meaning that filters will be shown after MaxPooling. The image to show is selected by the *idx* variable. As an example, the following values represent,\n",

    "## RNN: Sampling from a character model\n",
    "As a final exercise we are going to look into an example where a recurrent network is used to predict a sequence of characters. The model is autoregressive, meaning that the previous values $\\ldots, x_{i-2}, x_{i-1}$ is used to predict $x_i$. In the model characters are represented as vectors with the same number of elements as the number of unique characters in the sequence. The input in each sequence step is a single character, represented using \"one-hot\" coding, that is exactly one vector element is one, representing that particular character. The output is on the other hand a probability vector over all characters, which can be used to sample a character from the predictive distribution. To sample long sequences of characters, we feed one sampled character back into the network, to predict the character after that and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of characters that we are going to train on is the source code of Tensorflow (C++). The size of the downloaded source code is approximately 14 Mb, which means about 14 million characters in the sequence. The number of unique characters is 103. Therefore the output layer consists of 103 nodes with a softmax activation function. The RNN model itself is rather large, it consists of two layers of 1024 LSTM nodes in each layer. In addition to that there are skip-layer connections from input to second hidden layer and skip connections from first hidden layer to the output layer. In total there are about 13.5 million weights in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model take too long time to train as part of this lab. It takes days rather than minutes to train! Therefore pre-trained weights are handed out as part of the lab material. This is the file that you needed to download from an external URL!\n",
    "\n",
    "Given such a model we can now \"sample\" from it. Given some initial sequence of characters, as a seed, we can run the model for a number of sequence steps in order to find the sequence of predicted characters. But we can do more! Since the output is a vector of probabilities for new characters we can sample from it. As an example assume we only have 5 characters in our vocabulary and the prediction for a new character is:\n",
    "\n",
    "(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.0, 0.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "So the character represented by the third position would be selected since it has the largest probability. But if we treat these number as probabilities we can say that half of the times we are going to select the third character, 30% of the time we select the character represented by the second position and so on. To even make things more random we can modify these probabilities such that they become more equal (high temperature) or that the largest probability becomes even larger (small temperature). This temperature parameter *temp* can be changed so that the sampling becomes completely random (very high *temp*) or completely deterministic (very low *temp*).\n",
